This project pulls data from an API daily to grab county data for Florida and add it to a csv
addData.py grabs data from an API and adds it to the csv
grabCovidCases.py interprets the data and makes it into graphs. It also uses a separate API to get the death rate and hospitilization rate over time for the US
countyData.csv is all the grabbed
There is a .bat file that is used to run the script automatically each day.
